Current Task:

Refactor all code using the story principle.

Don’t forget about the loading nav bar. Also implement a fix so that you don’t show the icons when you flip the burger

Look at all your subscribes and make sure you’re unsubscribing

We should probably warn them before they delete all their shit. OOOOOR since its all posts, you save ALL DELETED POSTS for a short amount of time and store it in a garbage bin

Have to find a clean way not to load the edit menu for everyone

SLow down the entry animation of the add button to sync with the nav list dropping down. Make it smoother. 

You can preload the background image of the frosted glass if necessary by loading it off screen then bringing it on screen

Might need to either make it frosted glass permanently or give the users a choice to have frosted glass all the time

On click, resize the input button

 Bugs

 Froala editor script doesn't load on time
So in prime color picker we have the highlighting text bug and mobile bug. In the other color picker we have the non display bug. 
For now, we go with the prime color picker.
