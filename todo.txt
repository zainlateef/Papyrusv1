Current Task:

Refactor all code using the story principle.

Don’t forget about the loading nav bar. Also implement a fix so that you don’t show the icons when you flip the burger

Look at all your subscribes and make sure you’re unsubscribing

We should probably warn them before they delete all their shit. OOOOOR since its all posts, you save ALL DELETED POSTS for a short amount of time and store it in a garbage bin

Have to find a clean way not to load the edit menu for everyone

SLow down the entry animation of the add button to sync with the nav list dropping down. Make it smoother. 

You can preload the background image of the frosted glass if necessary by loading it off screen then bringing it on screen

Might need to either make it frosted glass permanently or give the users a choice to have frosted glass all the time

On click, resize the input button

 Bugs

 Froala editor script doesn't load on time
So in prime color picker we have the highlighting text bug and mobile bug. In the other color picker we have the non display bug. 
For now, we go with the prime color picker.

We reload the profile pic and the wrapper color for each page
So that has to happen in feed

edit mode on color picker


Can't store the stream tokens on the client side
Which means you need them on the server side. 

You get a list of links anyways

so call to the feed of the user
users feed has a stream

2 async requests should do it actually. 
One for the paginated froala posts, one for the stream if there is one
They're inserted into the feed sorted by time. 
Brilliant. 

content, timestamp, froala (flag),

Publish button and animation when you delete an icon

Also check out froala plugins

Froala bugs:
z index of toolbar going over mobile nav bar
publish button getting pushed off the side

toolbar sticky offset to solve one of those problems
