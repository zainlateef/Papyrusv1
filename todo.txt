Current Task:

Refactor all code using the story principle.

Don’t forget about the loading nav bar. Also implement a fix so that you don’t show the icons when you flip the burger

Look at all your subscribes and make sure you’re unsubscribing

We should probably warn them before they delete all their shit. OOOOOR since its all posts, you save ALL DELETED POSTS for a short amount of time and store it in a garbage bin

Have to find a clean way not to load the edit menu for everyone

SLow down the entry animation of the add button to sync with the nav list dropping down. Make it smoother. 

You can preload the background image of the frosted glass if necessary by loading it off screen then bringing it on screen

Might need to either make it frosted glass permanently or give the users a choice to have frosted glass all the time

On click, resize the input button

 Bugs

 Froala editor script doesn't load on time
So in prime color picker we have the highlighting text bug and mobile bug. In the other color picker we have the non display bug. 
For now, we go with the prime color picker.

We reload the profile pic and the wrapper color for each page
So that has to happen in feed

edit mode on color picker

I want the "books" icon for saving something to the library, but thats font awesome pro
If it becomes necessary to include more icons, switch to that icon and purchase font awesome pro


Can't store the stream tokens on the client side
Which means you need them on the server side. 

You get a list of links anyways

so call to the feed of the user
users feed has a stream

2 async requests should do it actually. 
One for the paginated froala posts, one for the stream if there is one
They're inserted into the feed sorted by time. 
Brilliant. 

content, timestamp, froala (flag),

Publish button and animation when you delete an icon

Also check out froala plugins

Froala bugs:
z index of toolbar going over mobile nav bar
publish button getting pushed off the side

toolbar sticky offset to solve one of those problems

Get it to where the publish button destroys and initializes. 
You have the view. That's fine. If you double click on the view, you hide the view and you initialize the editor. 
When you click publish, you hide the editor, which should be by destroying it. 
To get rid of the double model view you can have display none instead of ngif

Change the color picker for the right icons to be ngprime

There's a delay between the model update and the keyup event. Table it for now. If they press publish too fast they might see it
^^that's fixed if i can get the publish button to click from the outside
There are quite a few more bugs. The embedly cards don't render correctly when you toggle posts
ONe problem at a time. That's really not a terrible problem to have. Beyond that, the editor works beautifully.

header does not have a publish button. just click in  and click out

new post is the only one with a publish button because it's going to fire that post and then clear the html

everything else is click in and click out. 

The regular posts have a solid background color, same style as the main background color

It's taking shape. That's exciting. 
Still have to crack the froala editor open. It's not complete yet.

All the posts need a frame of some sort. But what?

Probably going to need that scroll bar lol

need to frame each post

limit the background colors they can choose. white, wheat, light blue, light pink. Extremely limited pallete so you don't have to change the header

The concept of the library is pretty awesome. In the library you have authors A-Z or you have posts by timeline
You also need an easy way to the library but the user menu is getting cluttered.
